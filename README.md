<p id="description">The libft project represents an essential C programming endeavor aimed at creating a foundational library. This library comprises a diverse collection of general-purpose functions crucial for various programming tasks. Serving as a fundamental building block for C programmers libft facilitates understanding of standard function implementations memory management and overall programming proficiency in C.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The libft project addresses the challenges encountered in C programming by providing a comprehensive library of essential functions. Through the implementation and utilization of these functions, developers gain valuable insights into their workings, ensuring efficiency and adherence to project guidelines. libft serves as a valuable resource throughout the journey of C programming, enabling developers to tackle various programming tasks effectively.</p>

<h2>Common Instructions</h2>

<p>Written in C language.</br>
Adherence to the Norm, including bonus files/functions.</br>
Functional integrity with no unexpected terminations or memory leaks.</br>
Submission of a Makefile meeting specific requirements.</br>
Encouragement to create test programs for self-evaluation and peer assessment.</p>

<h2>Mandatory Part</h2>

<p>The core of the libft project involves creating a library (libft.a) comprising various functions essential for C programming tasks. These functions replicate the behavior of standard libc functions, prefixed with 'ft_' to distinguish them. The project mandates adherence to technical considerations, including proper memory management and compilation flags.</p>

<h2>Bonus Part</h2>

<p>Upon completion of the mandatory part, developers are encouraged to delve deeper by implementing additional functionalities. This bonus part focuses on list manipulation, introducing structures and functions to handle linked lists effectively. Successful completion of the bonus part earns extra points, provided the mandatory part meets all requirements flawlessly.</p>

<p>The libft project serves as a foundational step in the journey of C programming, enhancing understanding of essential concepts and equipping developers with valuable skills for future endeavors.</p>
